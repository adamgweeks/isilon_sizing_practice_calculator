# isilon_sizing_practice_calculator
A self contained Javascript Isilon striping calculator for education purposes

This is a re-packing of the code that was formerly on www.isilon-additional.info (now defunct)

The calculator allows you to input different cluster sizes (number of nodes) data protection type (N+1, N+2:1 etc) and a data size before calculating how the strip would look.  This is for practising for the Isilon exams which have an expectation that the student understands how OneFS will stripe the data.
